# Leveraging BERT for Natural Language Understanding of Domain-Specific Knowledge
 We experiment with fine-tuning BERT to jointly detect the userâ€™s intent and the related slots, using a custom-generated dataset built around a organization specific
knowledge base. Our results show that well-constructed datasets lead to high detection performances and the resulting model has the potential to enhance a future task-oriented dialogue system.
